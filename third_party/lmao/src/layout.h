/**
 * Places a code block into a relative memory layout array.

 * The function finds the lowest unused starting position that satisfies

 * A RESERVED_CODE cell is inserted immediately before the first command cell.
 *
 * \param block                    First CodeBlock in the chain to place.
 * \param memory_layout            Memory layout array (size MALBOLGE_MEMORY_SIZE).
 * \param possible_positions_mod_94 Array of 94 bytes; non-zero entries mark valid
 *                                  start positions modulo 94.
 *                                  Value 2: preinitialized is allowed.
 *                                  Value 1: needs runtime initialization.
 * \param must_be_initialized      If non-zero the cells are marked CODE;
 *                                 otherwise PREINITIALIZED_CODE.
 * \return Non-zero on success; zero when no valid position was found.
