/**
 * Computes the Malbolge opcode for every used cell in the final memory layout.
 *
 * For CODE and PREINITIALIZED_CODE cells the opcode is derived from the xlat2
 * cycle and the cell's address.  For DATA cells the expression tree is
 * evaluated to a numeric value.  RESERVED_CODE cells are given a safe NOP-like
 * value.  UNUSED and RESERVED_DATA cells produce opcode -1.
 *
 * \param memory_layout         Final layout array (MALBOLGE_MEMORY_SIZE cells).
 * \param last_preinitialized   Address of the last cell that is part of the
 *                              pre-initialized (source-embedded) region.
 * \param opcodes               Output array (MALBOLGE_MEMORY_SIZE entries).
 *                              Each entry is the opcode for that address, or -1
 *                              if the cell is unused.
 * \param labeltree             Label BST used to resolve label references in
 *                              DATA expressions.
 * \param no_error_printing     If non-zero, error messages are suppressed.
 * \param ignore_fixed_offsets_in_preinitialized_section
 *                              If non-zero, DATA and invalid CODE cells in the
 *                              pre-initialized region are silently ignored
 *                              instead of causing an error.
