 * block and stores it on the DataAtom, then synthesizes virtual NOP CodeBlocks
 * before <label> as needed.
 *
 * For R_<label>: Validates that <label> resolves to a code-section cell that
 * has a successor (i.e. the R_+1 address is valid).
 *
 * \param datablocks  All parsed data-block chains.
 * \param codeblocks  All parsed code-block chains (may have first-element updated).
 * \param labeltree   Label BST for resolving names.
 * \return Non-zero on success; zero if any prefix could not be resolved.
